## 🚀 Overview

AgentBase is an open-source platform that simplifies the development, deployment, and management of AI agents. 

Like [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) did for backend services, AgentBase unifies the essential infrastructure components needed to build capable, connected, and stateful AI agents into a cohesive, developer-friendly platform.

## ✨ Features

AgentBase will provide everything you need to build and manage AI agents:

- **Agent Runtimes** - Execute agent logic with any framework
- **Persistent Memory** - Store context and conversations
- **Tool Integration** - Connect agents to external services and APIs
- **Model Routing** - Use any AI model with your agents
- **Orchestration** - Create multi-agent workflows
- **Observability** - Monitor agent activity with detailed logs
